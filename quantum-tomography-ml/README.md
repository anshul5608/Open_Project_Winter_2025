Quantum State Tomography using Machine Learning
Overview

This project implements a machine learning–based approach for Quantum State Tomography (QST).
The goal is to reconstruct a physically valid single-qubit density matrix from measurement data using a neural network while strictly enforcing quantum mechanical constraints.

This work is completed as part of Assignment 2 for the QCG × PaAC Open Project (Winter 2025–2026).

Objective

Reconstruct a single-qubit density matrix from Pauli measurement expectations

Ensure the reconstructed state is:

Hermitian

Positive Semi-Definite

Unit Trace

Report fidelity, trace distance, and inference latency

Approach

Track Chosen: Track 1 (Classical / Software-based ML)

Input: ⟨X⟩, ⟨Y⟩, ⟨Z⟩ expectation values

Model: Fully connected neural network (MLP)

Physics Enforcement: Cholesky decomposition
