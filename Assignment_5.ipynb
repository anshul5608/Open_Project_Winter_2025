    "# Assignment 5: Solving a 4×4 System with HHL\n",
    "This week we implement the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm for a simple two-qubit (4×4) linear system, check the answer against a classical solver, and reason about when HHL helps."

    "- **Scalability:** The theoretical speed-up assumes oracles that efficiently encode sparse Hermitian matrices and good condition numbers. Gate counts grow with the precision of phase estimation, so practical circuits still scale poorly once the matrix becomes dense or ill-conditioned.\n",
